Namaste Node.js

Node.js philosphy – js can run outside the browser 
 
Node.js is written in C++  
 
Node.js is a C++ applicatoin with V8 embeddd into it 
 
V8 can be embedded into any C++ programme 
 
What V8 does?  
executes JS code 
 
Cycle -> JS Code ------------------> V8 ------------------------> Machine understands and executes the code 
	                 Converts the code to machine level code 
	 
Inside a server --------> Inside Node.Js written in C++ -----------> V8 written in C++ 

V8 is a js engine - that follows ECMASCRIPT standards 

ECMASCRIPT is a standard for scripting languages 

ecmascript standard is folowed by JS, Actionscript and many other languages

NVM - node version manager

node -v -----> check version of node.js
npm -v ------> version of node package manager

REPL ---> Read Evaluate Print Loop --------> enter into REPL mode by typing node in terminal

Node.js is js runtime environment built on V8 engine
Node.js ----> V8 engine + superpowers

global object in browser accessible by - 
	- window
	- global
	- self
	- frames   
	- global is not defined in browser ------------- what are webworkers
global object in node js accessible by - 
	- global 
this logs - empty object in node js 

- global object is not part of V8 engine 
- global object is part of node.js 
- global object has setTimeout, setInterval 

globalThis - points to global object in every environment

#4

to execute a node app, we give node and then entry point the file name ----- node app.js

require function - including a module inside another module
- require any file or module another
- require runs the entire file on the spot
- modules by default protects the internals of files - protects funcitons and variables from leaking
- to use the functions and variables export and import
    - whatever we return form exports will be returned by the requirefunciton in another file
	- export multiple things from module by exporting objects

- this pattern of importing and exporting is called - COMMON JS MODULES (cjs)
	- by default cjs is enabled
	- module.exports from modules/ files
	- require() 
	- old way 
	- works in synchronous way - until and unless the file is loaded from require the below code won't work, blocks.
	- code is run in non-strict mode
- ES Modules (mjs) - another pattern of import and export - commonly used in react and angular
	- explicitly define in package json - type : module
	- need to specify extension name in this imo - without .js extension throws error
	- export function from files/ modules
	- import from whatever file
	- new way - and would become standard way of exporting and importing
	- async way available in ES6 modules
	- strict mode is default

- module.exports is an empty object
	- when making a folder a module by requireing files from that folder in it's indes.js then we can export it.
	- also no need to specify the indes.js file name in the extension when reqire from folder
	- whatevr u export from indes.js from a folder it can be required without the indes.js extension
- module is a collectoin of js code which is private to itself, and can be required when needed by anywhere

#5 Diving into the Nodejs github repo

all the code inside a module is wrapped into a function and then executed, just the way block scope works in js.
	- this is the reason why we cannot access variables and funcitons of another module unless it's required and exported
	- when we call require and give it a path - all this happens
	- also that function is IIFE (immedietly invoked function expression)
	- keeps variables and functions inside safe and private 
- How are functions and variables private in different modules?
	- IIFE and require statement - IIFE wraps the module code 
- How do u get access to module.export?
	- when the file/module is wrapped inside a function IIFE - that fucntion has module as a parameter
	- nodejs passes modules and requires as one of the parameters to the IFFE in which the code is wrapper
	
five step mechanish of require	
	1. Resolving the module 
		- can be ./localpath, .json, node:modules	
	2. Loading the module
		- load the file content according to file type
	3. Compile
		- Wraps inside an IFFE - wrapsafe as in node open source code 
		- string concatination - see the image for refernece
 			- how node.js wraps files - https://imgur.com/a/20lzsXF
	4. Code evaluation
		- in this step - module.exports is returned 
	5. Caching
		- now the module is cached, not to be loaded again and again

the js code is not directly passed to V8, it's wrapped inside IFFE and then passed to V8
